This is the source code (and media assets) for Stunt Playground 2.0.

This source release is NOT intended as an example of well-structured 
Ogre application programming.

however, it may be of use to some people, especially those interested 
in implementing vehicle physics with the Newton Game Dynamics physics 
engine.

The source code is being released with no license whatsoever.  Feel free
to use the code at your own risk, in any manner you choose.

please note that some changes in the most recent versions of Ogre or Newton
or OgreNewt may cause compile-time errors with this code.  I leave it up
to the user to make any necessary changes.


P.S. if anyone would be interested in porting Stunt Playground 2.0 over to
the Macintosh or any other platforms that support Ogre (portable systems,
etc)... please contact me at walaber@walaber.com.  I would love to see
this game running on as many platforms as possible!

thanks to everyone who helped me with this game, esp. those at the Ogre and
Newton Game Dynamics forums!!
